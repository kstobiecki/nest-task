## TODO's
What needs to be mentioned -> feel free to reorganize EVERYTHING in this app to your needs. Main purpose of this task is to present your skills :rocket: so if U have any kind of pattern / template / approach go with it! 

* [Task 1] We would like to add new element using POST endpoint /vizlib/items
* [Task 2] We would like to validate somehow that newly added item before saving it into the database
* [Task 3] We would like to cast those elements to specific format before returning to the UI (to not expose too much)

Additional points
* Proper status codes
* Any kind of error handling implementation
* Documentation (approach doesn't matter)
* Versioning
* Any kind of tests (just to show how U're testing apps)
* Migration (for example extending Item model with additional column)
* Soft deletes (new endpoint + migration)

Treat us as total noobs so everything what can be "fancy" would be nice to explain somehow -> comment in the code / README

Good Luck!!!
